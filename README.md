# Video Screensaver
A Windows screensaver that plays videos(with or without sound) and images.

This project is active thanks to the effort of [Michael Barnathan](https://sourceforge.net/u/metasquares/profile/).
I copied it from SourceForge(https://sourceforge.net/projects/videosaver/) and brought it over to GitHub to track my changes.

## Requirements
I am using this project with Visual Studio 2015, but I assume that it would work with VS2010 and all intermediate versions as well.

## Other Sources
I've added the ability to also show images for 10 seconds.
